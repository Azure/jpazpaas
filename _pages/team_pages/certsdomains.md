App Service allows developers to create, upload, or import private and public certificates. You can use these certificates to secure a custom domain name, or use them in your application code. You can also use [App Service Managed Certificates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/secure-your-custom-domains-at-no-cost-with-app-service-managed-certificates-preview/) to secure your domain at no extra cost.
